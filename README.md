Hi, I’m @shelle-mim, or Michelle Leong.

I'm studying Computer Science at Singapore Management Univerity, where I’m currently in my Final Semester. With a keen interest in Software Development, Machine Learning and Data Science, I am expected to graduate with a Bachelor of Science (CS IT Solution Development Major, Artificial Intelligence & Cyber-Physical Systems specialisations) at the end of this year (2023).

I am currently seeking jobs in these fields of interest, and am enthusiastic to continue contributing to innovative projects and further my growth as a developer.
