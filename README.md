Hi, I’m @shelle-mim, or Michelle Leong.

I'm studying Computer Science at Singapore Management Univerity, where I’m currently learning about software development and algorithm design.

With interests in Application development, Artificial Intelligence, IoT and Fintech, I am expected to graduate with a Bachelor of Science (Computer Science, AI and CPS tracks), with a second major in Technology for Business Solutions (Financial Technology).
